 * Indicator that a test is "clear box", generally used to indicate a test is calling a non-public API.
 * This is often useful when testing complex internal logic or exceptions that are difficult or near impossible
 * to simulate.
 * <p>
 * This is also in kiwi-test as part of its public API. However, because we don't want to create a cycle between
 * kiwi and kiwi-test (or create yet another library that both depend on) it is duplicated here in kiwi.
