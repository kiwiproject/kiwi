/**
 * The annotated <em>type</em> must have two fields that define a valid range, i.e. in the simplest configuration
 * {@link #startField()} must come before {@link #endField()}. You can have multiple {@link FieldRange} annotations
 * on a type, either as standalone annotations or inside a {@link FieldRanges} annotation.
 * <p>
 * The main restriction imposed by this annotation is that {@link #startField()} and {@link #endField()} must be
 * {@link Comparable}. It is also assumed that they are defined to both have the same type, e.g. both are Integer
 * or {@link java.time.Instant}. No guarantees are made if they are different types, and most likely unpredictable
 * results and/or exceptions will occur.
 * <p>
 * Note also that <em>direct field access using reflection</em> is used to obtain the start and end values as
 * currently implemented.
 * <p>
 * By default, null values are not allowed, and the range check is exclusive, meaning start cannot equal end. You can
 * change the default behavior using the various options.
 * <p>
 * In addition to ensuring that the start and end fields define a valid range, you can also constrain them to minimum
 * and/or maximum values.
 * <p>
 * Use the {@link #minLabel()} and {@link #maxLabel()} to specify custom labels to use in place of the min and max
 * values. This is useful in cases where the min and max are large numbers or when validating date/time values where
 * the min and max are specified as milliseconds since the epoch. Note specifically that when both a minimum and a
 * maximum are supplied, and you want to use labels, then you should supply both the min and max labels.
 * <p>
 * This validator's type support depends on whether minimum and maximum values are specified as part of the
 * configuration. If minimum and/or maximum are specified, then the supported types are the same as those supported
 * by {@link Range} since the minimum/maximum values must be converted from strings into the type of object that
 * the start and end fields are. If there are no minimum or maximum values defined, then any type that implements
 * {@link Comparable} is supported.
 * <p>
 * Finally, assuming there are no minimum or maximum values specified and that the type being validated contains
 * only a <em>time</em> component, e.g. {@link java.time.LocalTime LocalTime}, then there is an edge case between
 * 12:00 AM (00:00) and 1:00 AM (01:00) that may result in unexpected validation failures. For example, if the first
 * time in the range is 11:56 PM (23:56) and the second is 12:15 AM (00:15), then without a date to indicate whether
 * the times cross a midnight boundary, this range will be considered as invalid. The reason is simply that within a
 * single day (again because there is no date component to indicate otherwise), 12:15 AM always comes before 23:56 PM.
